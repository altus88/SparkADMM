{"name":"Spark ADMM","body":"### Welcome to Spark ADMM!\r\nADMM is a distributed optimization technique which lends itself nicely to an iterative map-reduce architecture. The Spark Framework provides the perfect platform for such a technique, as state can be maintained across iterations, something that is not easily supported by such projects as Hadoop.\r\n\r\nThis project is our attempt to show the performance benefits of using Spark for ADMM optimization\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sbt\r\n> compile\r\n> run\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Contact\r\n\r\njackdreilly@me.com","tagline":"ADMM implementation on Spark Cluster","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
